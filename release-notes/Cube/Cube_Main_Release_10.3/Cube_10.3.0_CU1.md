### Enhancements

#### SLAnalytics: Number of 'GetParameterMessages' requests has been optimized [ID_34936]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.1 -->

The number of *GetParameterMessages* sent by SLAnalytics in order to check whether a trended table parameter is still active has been optimized.

#### ListView component: Rows with an identical value will additionally be sorted by Name [ID_35500]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When, in a ListView component, you sort the rows by clicking a particular column header, from now on, all rows with an identical value in the column you sorted by will additionally be sorted by the *Name* column (in ascending order).

#### Bookings app: Default window of timeline area now set to '-8 hours <NOW> +16 hours' [ID_35525]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

In the *Bookings* app, the default window of the timeline area has now been changed from `-1 day <NOW> +1 day` to `-8 hours <NOW> +16 hours`.

This also means that a ListView component configured to list bookings will by default have its *StartTime=* and *EndTime=* options set to `NOW - 8 hours` and `NOW + 16 hours` respectively.

### Fixes

#### Trending: Pattern matching tags could incorrectly be defined for discrete or string parameters [ID_35368]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

Pattern matching does not support discrete or string parameters. However, up to now, when viewing a trend graph that showed trend information for either a discrete or a string parameter, it would incorrectly be possible to define tags for pattern matching. From now on, this will no longer be possible.

#### Trending: Tag icon was displayed after you selected a section of a trend graph even though it was not possible to define tags [ID_35378] [ID_35383]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, when the pattern matching feature was not enabled in *System Center* > *System settings* > *analytics config*, the tag icon was displayed after you selected a section of a trend graph even though it was not actually possible to define tags.

From now on, Cube will check whether the pattern matching feature is enabled each time you open a trend graph.

#### Problem with SLElement when stopping an EPM element [ID_35439]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When an EPM element was stopped, in some rare cases, an error could occur in SLElement.

#### Visual Overview: Problem with EnableFollowMode option of Resource Manager timeline [ID_35528]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you had specified the *EnableFollowMode* option in the *ComponentOptions* shape data field of a shape configured to display the Resource Manager timeline, in some cases, that option would incorrectly be disabled.

From now on, when you activate the follow mode by specifying the *EnableFollowMode* option, the timeline will move along with the current time. When you navigate away from the line that represents now while follow mode is enabled, follow mode will temporarily be paused. As soon as you navigate back in view of the line that represents now, follow mode will be activated again.

#### DataMiner Cube - Search box: Problem when loading templates after right-clicking an element and selecting 'Assign alarm template' or 'Assign trend template' [ID_35582]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When, in the search box in the middle of the Cube header bar, you enter the name of an element and right-click the suggested element, a context menu will open identical to that which opens when you click an element in the Surveyor.

However, when, in that context menu, you then selected *Protocols & Templates > Assign alarm template* or *Protocols & Templates > Assign trend template*, the available templates would not get loaded.

#### DataMiner Cube: Problem when receiving a notification from SLAnalytics while in alarm storm mode [ID_35596]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

An error could occur in DataMiner Cube when it received a notification from SLAnalytics while in alarm storm mode.

Also, from now on, DataMiner Cube will no longer group incident alarms into summary alarms while in alarm storm mode.

#### DataMiner Cube: Pattern edit menu would incorrectly open when you resized the selected area in a trend graph [ID_35627]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you resized the selected area in a trend graph by dragging either the left or right selection boundary, the pattern edit menu would incorrectly open, even when you were not allowed to create a pattern or when you had no intention of editing a pattern.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Problem when a session variable was used in an alarm filter [ID_35681]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you applied a filter to an alarm tab, no alarms would be shown when you had used a session variable in the filter.
